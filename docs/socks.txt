SOCKS
==========

i do *not* recommend you to run SOCKS proxy over unprotected network,
and you *definitely* shouldn't run SOCKSv4 over unprotected network
(unless you're such a generous person that you're okay with absolute
everyone using your proxy and bear the responsibility of all the
possible consequences), since SOCKSv4 is pretty much a plaintext
protocol.  this is here only because SOCKS is easy.  the user/password
auth is supported by storing username and their hashes /etc/passwd
style.

i only recommend you use the SOCKS part of rope as an emergency
measure.  support for other types of authentication is planned, but
you'll have to wait.


SOCKSv5 user database
---------------------

note that this is not intended to be used by many people.  the format
is as follows:

```
[username1]:[hash1]
[username2]:[hash2]
[username3]:[hash3]
[username4]:[hash4]
// ...
```
